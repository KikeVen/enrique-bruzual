# Getting started with pipenv

Now that you have a number of Python projects you are starting to realize, package conflicts are inevitable. You are left to wonder how to prevent this problem. You may have seen tutorials asking for you to **"pipenv install pipfile"** living you frustrated as you are not familiar with this way of working, regardless of the reason, perhaps it is time to start using **"pipenv"**

- **Environment:** Windows 10
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code

> These instructions are compatible with other Operating systems and IDEs

## pipenv benefits

**pipenv** was developed by **Kenneth Reitz** (@kennethreitz) as a temporary solution until the new **pip** specs are integrated

- Recommended by Python.org
- Easy to mage work environments
- Easy to share work environments
- Version integrity and control

## Python Packaging History

> It isn't required to understand the history of package management in order to use **pipenv**. I am only giving a little background into what's behind the effort, eventually **pipenv** should be integrated into **pip** (or become **pip**)

Historically the way Python managed packages was not ideal. After installing python, the user would have to download a zip file containing the package, unzip it, run "setup install". Or open the archive, copying the zip contents into the side packages folder, an inconvenience.

At the time PyPi was just an index of packages with links to where users could download the zip files. Now a days, when a package is registered, it must be uploaded to the website.

At the time all versions of Python were globally installed including the packages, this meant the user could not have two versions of a package. It also meant, if you developed an application using **X** version of a package, and needed to develop a new application using **N** version of that same package, it could potentially brake your code. As developers grew their environments, it would become more difficult to manage packages.

### Then: came easy_install

The user would just type easy_install the name of the package, the script would go to PyPi and look for it on the index and get the URL from where to downloaded. it didn't have an uninstall option and the integrity of the package depended on the publishers

### Later:  pip, virtualenv and requirements.txt

- **virtualenv** a virtual environment tool became popular to manage different development environments to host different instances of Python and required packages, now you could have multiple versions of packages running with out conflicting with one another, thus protecting the integrity of other projects
  
- **requirements.txt** became the file listing all the required resources for each virtualenv

- **pip** is an improvement over **easy_install**, as it has more command options for managing Python packages, Resolves, Downloads, Installs and Uninstalls Python packages. It uses the **requirements.txt** and it can manipulate virtual environments, so **pip** became the standard

**Python had no lock-file**, as found in other development communities, such as PHP, Ruby and Rust. Although package management had grown, it continue to have its shared of headaches due to a lack of lock-files. Although the **requirements.txt** filled much of the lock-file role, the other two tools, pip and virtualenv, did not have a seamless integration. Later, **pip-tools** was developed to integrate these tools, but again, they where all developed individually and each had their shortcomings, trying to update one could brake the others.

### The new: pipfile standard

- **Pipfile** replaces **requirements.txt**
- Uses the **TOML** file format
- It includes two groups **[[packages]]** and **[[dev-packages]]**
- **Pipfile** will eventually be integrated into **pip**

Sample of a **Pipfile**

```toml
[[source]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]

[packages]
spacy = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.6"
```

When the **Pipfile** is processed, it generates **Pipfile.lock**, it adds the following:

- Two groups, **"default"** and **"develop"**
- It contains all the dependencies, including version numbers and hashes for each entry.
- The file will be formated in **JSON** for easy machine parsing

Sample file block of **Pipfile.lock**

```json
{
    "_meta": {
        "hash": {
            "sha256": "19470a7a59afe1a70019f1dcb8c49c85ef5b22dcd5b8e35dc1669444376d88dd"
        },
        "pipfile-spec": 6,
        "requires": {
            "python_version": "3.6"
        },
        "sources": [
            {
                "name": "pypi",
                "url": "https://pypi.org/simple",
                "verify_ssl": true
            }
        ]
```

## Introducing **pipenv**

It integrates pipfile, pipfile.lock, pip and virtualenv in a seamless package automating the virtual environment. It also allows for hash authentication upon installation. It is the Official recommendation by python.org

### Install pipenv

Use **pip** to install **pipenv**. before installing it, you should update your version of **pip**

- **`pip install --upgrade pip`**
- In Windows **`> python -m pip install --upgrade pip`**

1. Install pipenv:
    - **`> pip install pipenv`**
2. Create a new project folder (Windows):
    - **`> md new_project`**
3. Navigate to the new folder
    - **`> cd new_project`**
4. Create a new pipenv in the new folder
    - **`> pipenv --python 3.6`** # or what ever version
    - This will create all the necessary files
5. Launch a subshell in pipenv
    - **`> pipenv shell`**
    - This will run pipenv version of Python
6. Install a new package in **new_project**
    - **`> pipenv install <package_name>`**
    - This will update the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock

I assume you are relatively new to Python, and if you are not familiar with pipenv, I recommend you to familiarize with this process, as you move forward it will become a requirement for developing new projects and sharing them.
