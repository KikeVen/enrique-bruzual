# Welcome to my personal site

It has been a long time coming, I have been working on multiple projects and felt it was time to share some of my work, I decided to start a modest page and see where it goes.

My primary focus is technology but I hope to share some of my other interests, specially photography. The site will continue to grow with multiple sections

* **Blog:** Post about one page opinion base articles
* **Projects:** A detail description, including visual media, of current ongoing projects
* **Tutorial**: This might be a stand alone website, with detailed instruction, and code sample complemented with video or/and diagrams to support the tutorials
* **Services:** A full list with descriptions of all the services I am able to offer

I am a Python programmer, although I have experience in C and Java, I am mainly focusing in Python. This is a flexible, well supported, high level programming language. Enabling me to cover a  wide range of interests, with a single language.

My primary interests are in **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Computer Vision** (CV), these two topics provide a foundation from where to utilize and deploy new supporting technologies. It could be a web app, phone app or automated service leveraging multiple API supporting the primary focus.

Please visit the [**About**]({{< ref "content/about/_index.md" >}}) section to learn more about me

Thank you for visiting and I hope this site can be of some help
